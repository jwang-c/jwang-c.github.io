								<p>Hi, there! Thank you for visiting my personal page. Hi, there! Thank you for visiting my personal page. I received the Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Scott Acton, from the <a href="http://viva-lab.ece.virginia.edu/index.html"> Virginia Image and Video Analysis Laboratory (VIVA)</a>, University of Virginia, USA. Besides, I received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia, USA, in 2017. I am expecting my diploma in December 2021 and I am actively seeking professional academic position in <strong>image processing</strong> and <strong>bioimage analysis</strong>.</p>
								<br>
								<p>My research interests include multi-dimensional image processing, biological and biomedical image analysis, object detection, bioinformatics, active surface models, graph analysis, shape analysis, and machine learning.</p>
								<br>
								<p>I defended my Ph.D. dissertation on <a href="https://doi.org/10.18130/vqv0-1b11"> “Segmentation and machine learning for the analysis of bacterial biofilm images”</a> in July 2021, under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/scott-t-acton"> Prof. Scott T. Acton</a>. This research is motivated as bacterial behavior in biofilms is closely related to important problems in energy, disease, and the basic biology. However, individual bacterial functionality in the complex 3D aggregations remains mysterious due to the limitations of image analysis techinques. Therefore, I developed algorithms for <strong>graph-based 3D single-cell segmentation</strong>, <strong>GAN-based biofilm image synthesis and evaluation</strong>, and <strong>shape-based biofilm reconstruction and analysis</strong>. These tookilts are able to locate, segment, and analyze individual bacteria in lattice light sheet microscopy images, and to overcome the image challenges in the lack of apparent structure, limited contrast between conterminous cells, and high density of cells. My research was funded by <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/projects/understanding-how-bacterial-communities-assemble-and-function"> Presidential Fellowship in Data Science</a> and Research Assistantship from National Institute of Health.</p>
								<br>
								<p>At the current stage, I am teaching "ECE 4750/ECE 6750 Digital Signal Processing" during Fall 2021 for the combined section of undergraduate and graduate students. I love my students and enjoy the process of teaching. The best moment for me was when my sweet students gave me endorsement and encouragement. </p>
								<br>
								<p>I am an active member of IEEE. I served as the Chair for IEEE Signal Processing Society Student Chapter at UVA from 2019 to 2021 and Co-Chair from 2018 to 2019. Before UVA, I was also engaged in various extracurricular activities, such as volunteering for the Asian Youth Games, and Presidential service for department student communities.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Lastly, a little more about my life. I am an optimist, nature lover, and enjoy traveling. I love to feel every moment of my life and hope to always stay positive and hopeful with pure grateful heart.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Please feel free to reach out to me at jiewang@virginia.edu. Have a wonderful day!</p>
